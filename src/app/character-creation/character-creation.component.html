<h2>Step 1: Background Selection</h2>
<p>
  To begin: Roll <b>D10</b> + <b>D10</b>. Using one of the two <b>D10</b> you
  just rolled, or by adding the two of them together, select a background,
  recording it in the characteristics section of your hero sheet. That provides
  you with some of your qualities (details on page 44), a principle (details on
  page 45), and a new set of dice to roll for power source for the next step.
